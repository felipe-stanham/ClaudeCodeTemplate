# Claude Code — Project Instructions

## Session Startup

**ALWAYS do this before anything else, regardless of task complexity:**
1. Read `MEMORY.md` if it exists.
2. Read `docs/SYSTEM.md` if it exists.
3. Read `docs/System/glossary.md` if it exists — this is the project's Ubiquitous Language. Every artifact and conversation must use its canonical terms.
4. Confirm with one line: "Loaded MEMORY.md ✓ / docs/SYSTEM.md ✓ / glossary.md ✓"
5. Do NOT read the artifact indexes (`docs/Pitches/INDEX.md`, `docs/Tasks/INDEX.md`, `docs/Projects/INDEX.md`) or any P/T/I file at startup. Load these only when the user asks to see open work or names a specific artifact.
6. Run `git branch --show-current` and act on the result:
   - `main` or `tst` → **STOP** and output: "WARNING: current branch is `{branch}` — a protected branch. Work happens on `dev` (planning) or in a task/scope worktree (code)." Do not write anything until the user says what to do.
   - `dev` → this is the planning checkout: pitches, tasks, specs, glossary. To write code, create or enter the task/scope worktree (see "Checkouts and Worktrees").
   - `task-T-*` / `scope-P-*` → this is a code worktree: run the Execution Loop for that task or scope.
7. If `.claude/.template-manifest` does not exist, output: "Template migration incomplete — run the `template-sync` skill." (The manifest is written by template-sync v1.0.0 or later.)

## System Context

- `docs/SYSTEM.md` is the always-loaded system index. It describes the existing system at a high level without requiring all project, task, or pitch files to be read.
- `docs/SYSTEM.md` must stay under ~150 lines. Detail belongs in individual P-xxxx.md, T-xxxx.md, or I-xxxx.md files. Lists of those artifacts live in their own index files (see below), not in docs/SYSTEM.md.
- `docs/SYSTEM.md` contains:
  - A brief description of what the system does and its main components
  - Key architectural decisions that must be respected across all projects
  - Architecture invariants and what enforces them (see the `arch-check` skill)
  - Cross-project constraints that apply to every session
  - Pointers to the artifact indexes (`docs/Pitches/INDEX.md`, `docs/Tasks/INDEX.md`, `docs/Projects/INDEX.md`)
  - A pointer to `docs/local/deployment.md` for deployment targets (do NOT inline targets here)
- Artifact indexes (one-line entries, link to the full file):
  - `docs/Pitches/INDEX.md` — open and archived pitches (`I-xxxx.md`)
  - `docs/Tasks/INDEX.md` — open and completed ad-hoc tasks (`T-xxxx.md`)
  - `docs/Projects/INDEX.md` — active and completed projects (`P-xxxx.md`)
- Never load individual project, task, or pitch files unless the user specifies which one to work on. Never load the indexes at session startup — load them only when the user asks "what's open" or to pick something to work on.
- When a project's final scope is marked `[DONE]`, update its entry in `docs/Projects/INDEX.md` to reflect completed status.
- If creating a new docs/SYSTEM.md or INDEX files, use templates at `docs/templates/`.

## Ubiquitous Language

- `docs/System/glossary.md` is the project's **Ubiquitous Language** — the canonical glossary of domain and system terms. It is always loaded at session startup.
- Use only the terms defined there in pitches, specs, code, commits, and conversation. Do not silently substitute synonyms — drift between speech and code is the bug this file exists to prevent.
- To add, edit, or remove a term — or to challenge terminology drift between artifacts — invoke the `glossary` skill. Do not edit `docs/System/glossary.md` by hand.
- If the user introduces a new domain word that isn't in the glossary, stop and propose adding it via the `glossary` skill before using it in any artifact.
- If creating a new `docs/System/glossary.md`, use the template at `docs/templates/GLOSSARY.template.md`.

## Git Ignore

Every project must have a `.gitignore` that excludes at minimum:
- `.env` — contains environment credentials
- `.deploy-secrets` — contains deployment credentials
- `docs/local/` — contains deployment targets and other host-specific notes that must not be shared
- Verify these are present before the first commit. If `.gitignore` does not exist, create one.
- *Enforced by* `03-no-secrets.sh` (denies `git add` / `git commit` while any of these is not ignored, tracked, or staged) and `.githooks/pre-commit`.

---

## General

- Work artifacts follow a maturity ladder: **Pitch (`I-xxxx.md`) → Task (`T-xxxx.md`) → Project (`P-xxxx.md`)**. See the "Work Artifacts" section below for details.
- **Every code change — however small — has a task or a project scope on record before any code is written.** No task yet? Create one with the `task` skill. This applies even in Auto Mode. *Enforced by* `04-task-before-code.sh`: code edits are denied outside a `task-T-*` / `scope-P-*` branch whose task/project file exists.
- The main session plans and orchestrates; it does not write production code. Code is written by the `implementer` agent through the Execution Loop (see below).
- When coding, do not modify the spec — if something in it is wrong or unclear, stop and ask.
- Do NOT work on a project, task, or pitch you have not been instructed to implement. I will name the specific file.
- Do NOT read all the files in `docs/Projects/`, `docs/Tasks/`, or `docs/Pitches/` unless instructed to. Use the corresponding `INDEX.md` if you need to scan what's open.
- Commit once per completed task or scope, at the end of the Execution Loop (not mid-implementation). Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- When blocked or at a decision point with no clear answer, stop and ask rather than guessing.
- Prefer the simplest solution that works. Do not create abstractions unless there are at least two concrete use cases today.

---

## Work Artifacts

There are three kinds of work artifact, ordered by maturity:

1. **Pitch — `docs/Pitches/I-xxxx.md`.** A half-formed idea being shaped. Use the `pitch` skill to iterate on a problem statement, constraints, success criteria, and out-of-scope items before deciding whether the idea is real. Pitches can sit indefinitely; they cost nothing.
2. **Task — `docs/Tasks/T-xxxx.md`.** A bounded ad-hoc piece of work that does not justify the full project ceremony. One scope, one branch, no separate spec package. Created with the `task` skill — either directly (small, well-understood change, or a hotfix) or from a pitch recommended as a Task.
3. **Project — `docs/Projects/P-xxxx.md`** plus a `docs/Projects/P-xxxx/` folder containing `spec.md`, `workflows.md`, `data_model.md`, `architecture.md`. Multi-scope work with cross-cutting impact. Created with the `spec` skill — directly, from a pitch recommended as a Project, or by promoting a task that has outgrown its bounds.

All three are planning artifacts: they live on `dev` and are committed and pushed as they are written (see "Checkouts and Worktrees").

### Pitches

- A pitch is started by invoking the `pitch` skill with a working title. The skill runs a back-and-forth refinement: clarify the problem, list constraints, define success criteria, identify what's explicitly out of scope.
- Output is `docs/Pitches/I-xxxx.md` with the refined writeup and a **Recommendation** (Task, Project, or Archive). Add a one-line entry to `docs/Pitches/INDEX.md`.
- A pitch ends in one of three ways: promoted to a Task, promoted to a Project, or archived (mark as `[ARCHIVED]` in the index with a one-line reason).

### Promotion: Task → Project

Promote a task to a project (and stop work on the task) when **any** of the following becomes true:

- The work naturally decomposes into more than 3 scopes.
- It touches more than one named subsystem/component in docs/SYSTEM.md.
- It requires schema or data-model changes (i.e., any change to `dataModel.md`).
- It requires a new external service, API, or integration.

When promoting (the `spec` skill does this): create `P-xxxx.md` and the spec package, link the originating `T-xxxx.md` from the project's spec, mark the task `[PROMOTED → P-xxxx]` in `docs/Tasks/INDEX.md`, and stop further work on the task file. Do not delete the task — it is the historical record of how the project started.

### Promotion: Pitch → Task or Project

The `pitch` skill applies the same four triggers above at the end of refinement and **recommends** the next step; it does not create the next artifact. If none fire, it recommends a Task and the `task` skill performs the promotion; if any fire, it recommends a Project and the `spec` skill performs it. The promoting skill sets the pitch to `Promoted → T-xxxx / P-xxxx` and updates `docs/Pitches/INDEX.md`.

### Definition of Ready

A task, or a project scope, may be handed to the `implementer` only when it has:

- **Goal** — 1–2 lines, glossary terms only
- **Touches** — the files/modules expected to change, plus an existing file to use as the pattern reference
- **Tasks** — action-oriented checklist
- **Acceptance Criteria** — declarative `- **name:** input → expected output`
- **OUT of scope / No-gos** — stated as constraints
- **Open Questions** — empty

The `task` skill, the `spec` skill, and `docs/templates/TASK.template.md` follow this list. The `implementer` checks it first and returns `BLOCKED: <question>` when something is missing.

---

## Memory

- `MEMORY.md` is the index for persistent learnings. Auto memory (Claude Code's built-in system) is disabled for this project.
- Never solve the same problem twice — if you're re-discovering something, it belongs in memory.

### Structure

- `MEMORY.md` — lightweight index. Each entry is a one-line description. Simple learnings (one or two sentences) live inline here.
- `memory/` — detailed memory files. When an entry needs more context, explanation, or examples, create a file in `memory/` and link it from the index.

### Format

```
## Index

- **[date] env-pip-flag:** pip on this system requires `--break-system-packages` flag.
- **[date] api-auth-retry:** Auth token refresh logic and retry pattern. → [memory/api-auth-retry.md](memory/api-auth-retry.md)
- **[date] deploy-homeserver-quirks:** SSH and restart sequence for homeserver. → [memory/deploy-homeserver-quirks.md](memory/deploy-homeserver-quirks.md)
```

### Rules

- At session startup, read `MEMORY.md` (the index only). Load individual memory files only when relevant to the current task.
- Keep the index scannable — one line per entry, no paragraphs.
- If a learning applies only to a specific project and is already captured in that project's docs, do not duplicate it in memory.
- Entries must be self-contained plain text — no links to external files or ~/.claude paths.

---

## Environments

Every project must support at least two environment configurations: **dev** (local development and testing) and **prod** (production).

### Configuration

- Environment is selected via `ENV` variable in `.env` (values: `dev`, `tst`, `prod`). Default is `dev`.
- Each environment has its own configuration block in `.env`. Use a prefix convention:
  ```
  ENV=dev
  # Dev environment
  DEV_API_URL=https://dev.example.com
  DEV_API_USER=dev-user@example.com
  DEV_API_TOKEN=dev-token
  # Prod environment
  PROD_API_URL=https://prod.example.com
  PROD_API_USER=prod-user@example.com
  PROD_API_TOKEN=prod-token
  ```
- The config module must load the correct set of credentials based on `ENV`. Shared settings that are the same across environments do not need a prefix.
- If a project does not have external services (pure local app with no API), the `ENV` variable is still required but may only affect logging verbosity or output paths.

### Rules

- **Never run tests against prod.** All automated and manual testing uses `dev` environment only.
- **Never run destructive operations (create, update, delete) against prod** unless the user explicitly confirms.
- Before executing any test or destructive operation, verify the active environment. If `ENV=prod`, stop and warn the user.

---

## Deployment

- Use the appropriate skill when deploying.
- **Targets and procedures** live in `docs/local/deployment.md` (gitignored — never committed). This file lists `dev` / `tst` / `prd` hosts, SSH details, restart sequences, and host-specific quirks. Keep `docs/local/` gitignored so the repo can be shared publicly without leaking infrastructure detail.
- **Secrets** are in `.deploy-secrets` (gitignored, never committed). Keep secrets out of `docs/local/deployment.md` — it documents *where* and *how*, not credentials.
- `docs/SYSTEM.md` may reference `docs/local/deployment.md` by name but must not inline target details.
- After any deployment incident or procedural change, update both the corresponding skill and `docs/local/deployment.md` to reflect what actually works.
- Never deploy to `prd` without explicit user confirmation.

---

## Logging

- Use the language-appropriate logging framework. Never use `print()`, `console.log()`, or equivalent debug output for operational output.
- Stack-specific logging setup (library, format config) belongs in `docs/SYSTEM.md`.
- Log level is controlled by environment: `dev` defaults to `DEBUG`, `prod` defaults to `WARNING`.
- Log format must include: timestamp, level, module name, and message. Example: `2026-03-20 14:30:00 [INFO] fetcher: Fetched 12 children for FEAT-100`.
- Log to stdout/stderr by default. File logging is added only if the project requires it.
- What to log:
  - **INFO:** Key operation milestones (start/end of major workflows, external API calls, file writes).
  - **DEBUG:** Detailed internal state useful during development (variable values, loop iterations, config loaded).
  - **WARNING:** Recoverable issues (missing optional config, fallback behavior triggered, retries).
  - **ERROR:** Failures that stop an operation (API errors, missing required config, file write failures).
- Never log secrets, tokens, or full API responses containing sensitive data. Mask or omit them.

---

## Branching Strategy

### Branch Hierarchy

```
main (production-ready)
 └── tst (testing / staging — deploys to tst targets)
      └── dev (integration + planning — all scope and task work merges here)
           ├── scope-P-XXXX-1-<short-description>
           ├── scope-P-XXXX-N-<short-description>
           └── task-T-XXXX-<short-description>
```

- **`main`** — Production-ready code. Only receives merges from `tst` after explicit user approval (and hotfix task branches). Maps to `prd` deployment targets.
- **`tst`** — Testing/staging branch. Receives merges from `dev` after all regression tests pass. Used to deploy to `tst` targets for validation.
- **`dev`** — Integration branch, and home of every planning artifact. Receives planning docs directly and code only through merges of task/scope branches.
- **`scope-P-XXXX-N-<short-description>`** — One branch per scope of a project, branched from `dev`.
- **`task-T-XXXX-<short-description>`** — One branch per task, branched from `dev` (from `main`/`tst` for a hotfix). If the task is promoted to a project mid-flight, stop and continue on `scope-P-YYYY-1-<...>` instead.

### Checkouts and Worktrees

- **The primary checkout stays on `dev`.** It is where planning happens: the `pitch`, `task`, `spec`, and `glossary` skills only run there, and commit + push their artifacts to `dev` as they are written.
- **All code is written in a worktree** — one per task/scope branch, even with a single session:
  `git worktree add ../<repo>-wt/<branch> -b <branch> dev` (base `main`/`tst` for a hotfix).
  Worktrees live in a sibling directory, not inside the repo. Remove them after the merge: `git worktree remove ../<repo>-wt/<branch>`.
- **Parallel sessions** — run one session per worktree. Never manually clone the repo into separate folders. Do not use `isolation: worktree` for the `implementer` — it must work in the task/scope worktree the main session is in.

| Change | Committed on | By |
|---|---|---|
| Pitches, tasks, projects/specs, glossary, their INDEX entries | `dev` (primary checkout), pushed as written | planning skills |
| Spec or task edits during implementation (after `BLOCKED:`) | `dev` (primary checkout), then `git merge dev` into the task/scope branch | main session |
| Code + `docs/System` updates | the task/scope branch | main session (Execution Loop) |
| Status (`[IN PROGRESS]`, `[DONE]`, `[x]`), INDEX status, tests promoted into `TESTS.md` | `dev`, right after the branch merges | main session |

### Rules

- Scope and task branches are created from `dev`. Never branch off another scope or task branch.
- **Never commit code to `dev`.** Every code change — however small — gets a `T-xxxx.md` (via the `task` skill) and a `task-T-xxxx-*` branch. *Enforced by* `04-task-before-code.sh`.
- **Never commit directly to `main` or `tst`.** They receive merges only. *Enforced by* `02-protected-branch.sh`: committing, merging, or pushing to `main`/`master`/`tst` asks for your approval — that approval is the promotion or hotfix authorization.
- **Hotfix (rare):** only when the user explicitly says "hotfix" and the change cannot wait for a normal promotion cycle. The `task` skill creates `T-xxxx.md` on `dev` with `Base: main` (or `tst`) → branch `task-T-xxxx-hotfix-<desc>` from that base → normal Execution Loop → merge into the base (approval prompt) → merge the same branch into `dev`. Note the hotfix in the commit message. No edits directly on `main`/`tst`, ever.

### Promotion Flow

1. **Task/scope → `dev`:** When the Execution Loop finishes (review passed, tests executed and passed, docs updated, branch pushed), merge the branch into `dev`. Then, on `dev`: mark the task/scope `[DONE]`, update its INDEX entry, promote critical acceptance criteria into `TESTS.md`, and push. Delete the branch and remove its worktree.
2. **`dev` → `tst`:** When the project is complete (all scopes `[DONE]`), run regression tests on `dev`. If all pass, merge `dev` into `tst` and deploy to `tst` targets for validation.
3. **`tst` → `main`:** After I review and approve on `tst`, merge `tst` into `main`. Deploy to `prd` targets.

---

## Planning

Always plan before coding:
- If working on a **Pitch**, invoke the `pitch` skill — do not write code from a pitch; pitches must be promoted to a Task or Project first.
- If working on a **Project** `P-xxxx.md`, read the spec package (`spec.md`, `workflows.md`, `data_model.md`, `architecture.md`) in the corresponding `P-xxxx/` folder — these contain the plan.
- If working on a **Task** `T-xxxx.md`, read the task file directly. Before starting, re-check the four promotion triggers in "Work Artifacts" — if any now apply, stop and promote to a project instead of expanding the task.
- For new work with no task or project yet — including small changes and hotfixes — invoke the `task` skill. It writes `docs/Tasks/T-xxxx.md`, adds the `INDEX.md` entry, and pushes both to `dev`.
- A task or scope is handed to the `implementer` only when it meets the **Definition of Ready** (see "Work Artifacts").

Make sure to follow the latest documentation when coding:
1. Read `architecture.md`, `dataModel.md` and `workflows.md` from the `docs/System/` folder.
2. Explore relevant files, patterns, and existing implementations.

---

## Execution Loop

How every task or scope is built. The main session runs it from the task/scope worktree and orchestrates the agents; it does **not** write production code itself — all code changes go through the `implementer`, including small ones.

1. **Ready:** confirm the branch matches the work item (`task-T-xxxx-*` / `scope-P-xxxx-N-*`) and the item meets the Definition of Ready. On `dev`, mark it `[IN PROGRESS]` and push.
2. **Implement:** invoke `implementer` (sonnet · xhigh) with the work-item path.
   - `BLOCKED: <question>` → ask the user, update the spec/task on `dev` in the primary checkout, push, `git merge dev` into the branch, re-invoke.
3. **Review:** invoke `code-reviewer` (opus · xhigh). BLOCK → rework.
4. **Test:** invoke `tester` (opus · high) on the acceptance criteria. FAIL → rework.
5. **Rework:** re-invoke `implementer` with `model: opus` and the findings verbatim, then go back to step 3. **At most 2 rework cycles per task/scope in total** (review and test failures share the counter); after that, stop and escalate to the user with the findings.
6. **Document:** invoke `doc-updater` (sonnet · medium). It ends with `DOCS: updated …` or `DOCS: no changes needed`.
7. **Commit:** one commit with the code, the tester's `tests/cache/` scripts, and the docs. If doc-updater reported `no changes needed`, add the trailer `Docs-Checked: no-changes` to the commit message. Push the branch.
8. **Merge:** follow "Promotion Flow" step 1.

Fable is used only when the user asks for it — for planning by switching the session model, for a rework by passing `model: fable` to the `implementer`.

### Review checklist (code-reviewer)

- Adherence to the project's architecture principles and invariants (from `docs/SYSTEM.md`)
- Correct environment handling (no hardcoded credentials, proper ENV checks)
- Code simplicity (no unnecessary abstractions)
- Consistency with existing patterns in the codebase
- Scope discipline (only the files listed under Touches; OUT-of-scope items respected)

Do not commit until the review passes.

---

## Testing

- **Tests must be executed, not reviewed.** No scope or task can be marked `[DONE]` based on code review alone.
- **Always test against `dev` environment.** Before running any test, verify `ENV != prod`. If it is, stop and warn the user.
- Tests that create, modify, or delete external resources must use dev/sandbox credentials only.
- Test entries use the declarative format: `- **test_name:** [concrete input] → [expected output]`
- **Scope acceptance criteria** live in the `P-xxxx.md` / `T-xxxx.md` file itself. **Regression tests** live in `TESTS.md` at the repo root.
- Acceptance tests run in step 4 of the Execution Loop. All must pass before the branch is committed and merged.
- Before merging `dev → tst`, delegate to the `tester` agent for regression tests. If any fail, do not merge.
- When a scope is marked `[DONE]`, promote critical-path acceptance criteria into `TESTS.md`. Keep it small — do not dump every scope test in.

---

## Progress Tracking

- `P-xxxx.md`, `T-xxxx.md`, and `I-xxxx.md` are the single source of truth for the status of their work item. Keep them current.
- Status is updated on `dev` (primary checkout), not on task/scope branches — parallel scopes would otherwise conflict on the same Scope Summary table.
- Scope/task status: `[ ]` → `[IN PROGRESS]` (when the Execution Loop starts) → `[DONE]` (after the branch merges). Mark sub-items `[x]` at the same time.
- Never mark a Scope `[DONE]` unless its tests have been **executed and passed** (not just reviewed).
- When a P/T/I file's top-level status changes (e.g., a project finishes, a task is promoted, a pitch is archived), update its one-line entry in the corresponding `INDEX.md` in the same commit. The indexes are a derived view but must not drift from the files they list.

---

## Documentation

- Document all APIs as part of the task that implements them. REST APIs must use OpenAPI.
- The `doc-updater` agent updates `docs/System/workflows.md`, `architecture.md`, and `dataModel.md` in step 6 of the Execution Loop, based on what actually changed. Its changes are committed with the code.
- `docs/System/dataModel.md` always reflects the **current** schema. Migrations are project-level artifacts — manage them within the project's own directory, not in `docs/System/`.
- *Enforced by* `01-check-docs-before-push.sh`: a push whose commits change source files is denied unless they also touch `docs/System/` or carry the `Docs-Checked: no-changes` trailer.

---

## Hard Gates

Hooks in `.claude/hooks/pre-tool/template/` that block or ask before a tool call runs. Project-specific hooks go in `.claude/hooks/<type>/project/` (contract in `.claude/hooks/pre-tool/template/lib/dispatch.sh`).

| Hook | Trigger | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `01-check-docs-before-push.sh` | `git push` | Deny: source changed without `docs/System/` updates or `Docs-Checked: no-changes` |
| `02-protected-branch.sh` | `git commit` / `merge` / `cherry-pick` / `revert` on, or `git push` to, `main`/`master`/`tst` | Ask the user |
| `03-no-secrets.sh` | `git add`, `git commit` | Deny: `.env`, `.deploy-secrets`, `docs/local/` not ignored, tracked, staged, or force-added |
| `04-task-before-code.sh` | Edit/Write on code (not `docs/`, `*.md`, `.claude/`, `.gitignore`, `.githooks/`, `tests/cache/`) | Deny outside a `task-T-*` / `scope-P-*` branch with an existing task/project file |
| `05-arch-check-before-push.sh` | `git push` | Deny when `.claude/arch-check.sh` (if present) fails — see the `arch-check` skill |

**Hard gates vs code-reviewer:** gates catch mechanical rule breaks (wrong branch, secrets, missing docs, broken invariants) before they happen; the `code-reviewer` judges what a script cannot (design, simplicity, consistency). Gates are not a sandbox: `04` sees only the Edit/Write tools, so a file written through Bash bypasses it. Never route around a gate — if one blocks you, fix the cause or ask the user.

---

## Template Sync

This project uses `ClaudeCodeTemplate` as its base template. To pull in the latest template updates (new skills, agent improvements, hook changes):

> **Run skill:** `template-sync`

The skill updates `CLAUDE.md`, the template-owned files in `.claude/skills/` and `.claude/agents/` (listed in `.claude/.template-manifest`), `.claude/hooks/*/template/`, the dispatchers, and the template's hook entries in `.claude/settings.json`. It never touches `docs/SYSTEM.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `.claude/arch-check.sh`, project skills/agents, or your hook scripts under `.claude/hooks/*/project/`. Breaking changes per version are listed in `.claude/skills/template-sync/MIGRATIONS.md`.

See `.claude/skills/template-sync/SKILL.md` for details.
